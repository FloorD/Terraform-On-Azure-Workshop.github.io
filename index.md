## What's this spacy badger doing here?

Our [Azure Heroes](https://aka.ms/azure.heroes) astronaut badger is ready go onto a mission to start his space delivery food service. For that, he needs your help to assemble his food delivery website using [Terraform](https://terraform.io) and [Azure](https://azure.com).

Through a series of 5 coding challenges, you can help them get their website up and running in Azure, with the help of Terraform. This way, they can focus on delivering your moon cheese, or neptuna on time!

*Are you ready to show your Terraform and Azure skills to send our astronaut badger into space?*


## When is this mission launching? 

We will be releasing the first coding challenge on **Monday, June 22, 2PM CEST** ‚åö, right after the @hashiconf keynote.
