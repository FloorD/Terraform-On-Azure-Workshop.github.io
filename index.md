## What's this spacy badger doing here?

Our [Azure Heroes](https://aka.ms/azure.heroes?ocid=aid3015373_ThankYou_DevComm&eventId=HashiConfTerraformonAzure_JK1-K2-hoArJ) badger has a startup idea that is out of this world! For their interstellar delivery service, they need your help developing an app leveraging the best of [Terraform](https://terraform.io), [Azure](https://azure.com), and Azure managed Kubernetes. Help them deploy their application, so they can concentrate on the quality of their galactic snacks.

*Are you ready to show off your Terraform and Azure skills to send our astronaut badger into space?*

## When is this mission launching? 

We will release the first coding challenge on **Monday, June 22, at 2PM CEST sharp** ‚åö, right after the [HashiConf keynote](https://hashiconf.com/digital-june/).

## What can I do in the meantime?
